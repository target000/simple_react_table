This is a test project to basically connect the backend and frontend.
The goal is to familiarized myself with react, material ui and express framework.

A step by step instructions will be added later.

To build FE code:
npm run-script build
This ought to generate a 'build' folder which is optimized and will be servered later.

To run server:
- Go to the root dir
- node server.js

Issues:
Originally had issue with push code to github. If the issue resurfaces, please update the url using https which should absolve the client from being authenticated.
